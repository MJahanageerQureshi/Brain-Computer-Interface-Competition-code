# Brain-Computer-Interface-Competition-code
This code was used for the 2017 Air Tech Brain Computer Interface Competition in Air University.
The code has three stages

-> The code applies various ML algorithms to the data provided and estimate their accuracies using a K-folds.

-> After this a Deep Neural Network is applied and its accuracies are judged as well.

-> The features from the last layer of the network are used to train several ML algorithms

The model with the highest accuracy is chosen and further optimized (But that isnt included)
